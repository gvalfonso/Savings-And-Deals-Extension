Savings and Deals was a Chrome extension I made in 2022.
It uses Shopee and Lazada APIs to search for the best deals for the item you are currently looking at.

It was made obsolete after the APIs were updated.
I stopped maintaining it for my family after I saw that searching for an item on these websites was one of the "fun" things about shopping and the extension took that fun away.
